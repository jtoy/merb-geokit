merb_geokit
=================

A plugin for the Merb framework that provides the geokit rails plugin.

Install with
# gem install merb_geokit

Include it in Merb in your dependencies.rb file
dependency "merb_geokit"

When you first startup merb it will copy a default geokit.rb file
to your config directory.  You should edit that file and add your API
keys to it.

If you want to store the geocode location of the user in a session
or cookie, based on IP address, then add the following to the top of
the Application controller

before :store_ip_location

Everything else works just like it does in rails.  


** NOTE:
Right now this plugin only works with ActiveRecord and only with mysql.

This plugin also adds rake tasks.  You must supply the variable in as
an ADDR environmental variable.  

$ rake -T geo

rake geo:ip      # Lookup up the address of an IP
rake geo:google  # Look up an address on google
rake geo:yahoo   # Look up an address on yahoo
rake geo:us      # Look up an address on us_geocoder
rake geo:ca      # Look up an address on ca_geocoder
rake geo:multi   # Look up an address using the failover

For example:

rake geo:ip ADDR="72.14.207.99"
rake geo:google ADDR="1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC"
rake geo:yahoo ADDR="1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC"
rake geo:us ADDR="1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC"
rake geo:ca ADDR="1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC"
rake geo:multi ADDR="1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC"
